Project: Speech to Text Recognition using PyAudio <br/>
Welcome to the Speech to Text Recognition project repository! This project leverages the PyAudio library to convert spoken language into written text, offering a seamless and efficient way to transcribe audio input in real-time. Below you'll find a comprehensive overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.
<br/>
Project Overview <br/>
The Speech to Text Recognition project aims to provide an accurate and reliable tool for converting speech into text using Python and the PyAudio library. Whether you're looking to transcribe meetings, create subtitles for videos, or build voice-activated applications, this project serves as a robust starting point.
<br/>
Features<br/>
Real-Time Transcription: Converts spoken words into text in real-time with minimal latency.<br/>
High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced speech recognition algorithms to ensure accurate transcriptions.<br/>
Customizable Settings: Allows users to adjust parameters such as language, audio input source, and more.<br/>
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.<br/>
Easy Integration: Simple to integrate with other applications and services via APIs.<br/><br/>
Technologies Used<br/>
Python: The primary programming language for this project.<br/>
PyAudio: A library for working with audio streams in Python.<br/>
SpeechRecognition: A library for performing speech recognition, including various engines like Google Web Speech API.<br/>
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and handling audio data.<br/><br/>


Usage<br/>
Once the application is running, it will listen for audio input through your default microphone. Speak clearly into the microphone, and the application will transcribe your speech into text displayed on the console.<br/>
